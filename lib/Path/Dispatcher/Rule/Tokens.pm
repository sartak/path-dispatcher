=head1 NAME

Path::Dispatcher::Rule::Tokens - predicate is a list of tokens

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $rule = Path::Dispatcher::Rule::Tokens->new(
        tokens    => [ "comment", "show", qr/^\d+$/ ],
        delimiter => '/',
        block     => sub { display_comment(shift->pos(3)) },
    );

    $rule->match("/comment/show/25");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Rules of this class use a list of tokens to match the path.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 tokens

Each token can be a literal string, a regular expression, or a list of either
(which are taken to mean alternations). For example, the tokens:

    [ 'ticket', [ 'show', 'display' ], [ qr/^\d+$/, qr/^#\w{3}/ ] ]

first matches "ticket". Then, the next token must be "show" or "display". The
final token must be a number or a pound sign followed by three word characters.

The results are the tokens in the original string, as they were matched. If you
have three tokens, then C<< match->pos(1) >> will be the string's first token
("ticket"), C<< match->pos(2) >> its second ("display"), and C<< match->pos(3)
>> its third ("#AAA").

Capture groups inside a regex token are completely ignored.

=head2 delimiter

A string that is used to tokenize the path. The delimiter must be a string
because prefix matches use C<join> on unmatched tokens to return the leftover
path. In the future this may be extended to support having a regex delimiter.

The default is a space, but if you're matching URLs you probably want to change
this to a slash.

=head2 case_sensitive

Decide whether the rule matching is case sensitive. Default is 1, case
sensitive matching.
