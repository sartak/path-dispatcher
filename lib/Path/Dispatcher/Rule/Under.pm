=head1 NAME

Path::Dispatcher::Rule::Under - rules under a predicate

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ticket = Path::Dispatcher::Rule::Tokens->new(
        tokens => [ 'ticket' ],
        prefix => 1,
    );

    my $create = Path::Dispatcher::Rule::Tokens->new(
        tokens => [ 'create' ],
        block  => sub { create_ticket() },
    );

    my $delete = Path::Dispatcher::Rule::Tokens->new(
        tokens => [ 'delete', qr/^\d+$/ ],
        block  => sub { delete_ticket(shift->pos(2)) },
    );

    my $rule = Path::Dispatcher::Rule::Under->new(
        predicate => $ticket,
        rules     => [ $create, $delete ],
    );

    $rule->match("ticket create");
    $rule->match("ticket delete 3");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Rules of this class have two-phase matching: if the predicate is matched, then
the contained rules are matched. The benefit of this is less repetition of the
predicate, both in terms of code and in matching it.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 predicate

A rule (which I<must> match prefixes) whose match determines whether the
contained rules are considered. The leftover path of the predicate is used
as the path for the contained rules.

=head2 rules

A list of rules that will be try to be matched only if the predicate is
matched.
